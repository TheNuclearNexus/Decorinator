# Decorinator
<!-- END HIDE -->

Decorinator is a library and does not add much on it's own. Other packs can add decorations through the API and let users place them around their world. 

## Crafting recipe
This pack relies on the [Smithed Crafter library](https://smithed.net/packs/crafter) for it's recipes. The below are crafted in the **Heavy Workbench** not the the regular crafting table.

![Crafting recipe](https://github.com/TheNuclearNexus/Decorinator/blob/main/other/recipe.png?raw=true)

## Usage
### Placing Blueprints
You can place blueprints by placing them in your offhand and then right clicking with the decorinator.
This will put the blueprint down and lock it to your cursor.

### Opening the menu
Right clicking the decorinator in the air will open up the radial menu.<br/>

The cog will swap the amount of snapping, shifting will moving or rotating will disable snapping entirely. <br/>
The arrows will put the decorinator in `move` mode, allowing you to move the decoration around. <br/>
The circular arrows will put the decorinator in `rotate` mode, this will cause the piece to rotate towards you. <br/>
The X will put the decorinator in `delete` mode, right clicking on decorations will place them back into your inventory. <br/>

### Shortcuts
Dropping the decorinator while holding a decoration will swap between `move` and `rotate`.
Shift-dropping the decorinator will delete the decoration.

## Duplicating blueprints
All blue-blueprints can be duplicated in the [**Heavy Workbench**](https://smithed.net/packs/crafter) using the following recipe:
```
LLL
LBL
LPL
``` 
Where `L` is Lapis Lazuli, `B` is the blueprint, and `P` is paper.
